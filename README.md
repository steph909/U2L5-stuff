# U2L5: Assignment - Calling Methods That Return Values
Homework Problems for CSAwesome Unit 2 Lesson 5

## Construction Costs
### Statement
The `Construction` class is completed for you and you will use it as a client, but you may want to look at it to make sure you understand how to use it.

Then write a program in the `ConstructionTester` class's `main` method that asks the user to enter the sales tax rate as a decimal, the number of boards needed, and the number of windows needed.

Create a `Construction` object to compute the cost of the lumber and windows. Use $8 for the cost of lumber. Use $11 for the cost of windows.
Print the total cost. Then use the method to compute the tax and print out the grand total including tax.
 
### A sample program run should match exactly as below:
```
Enter the sales tax rate: 
.08
How many boards do you need? 
10
How many windows do you need? 
5
Total: 135.0
Grand Total: 145.8
```


## How Far Away is ...?
### Statement
In this exercise you will write a program to compute the distance between any two geo locations.
The `GeoLocation` class is completed for you and you will use it as a client, but you may want to look at it to make sure you understand how to use it.

Then write a program in the `HowFarAway` class's `main` method that asks the user for four numbers.

1. starting latitude
2. starting longitude
3. ending latitude
4. ending longitude

Then, using the `GeoLocation` class, compute the distance in miles between the two locations.
A sample program run should match exactly as below:

 
### A sample program run should match exactly as below:
```
Enter the latitude of the starting location: 48.8567
Enter the longitude of the starting location: 2.3508
Enter the latitude of the ending location: 51.5072
Enter the longitude of the ending location: 0.1275
The distance is 208.08639358288565 miles.
```
